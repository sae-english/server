      "text": "SPACE. But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy. Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut? Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE. The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES. The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole. Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own. The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse. The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass. The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert. An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.",

The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.

As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold. After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home. Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along? Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent. Finally, he sits down in the snow to die. As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow. He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra.

They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the cylinder into shade, then darkness. The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night. EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out. After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows. As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox. Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor. Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful. Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes. Nothing happens. He punches in a few more. Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.",
